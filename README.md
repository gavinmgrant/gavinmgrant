### About me

Software engineer leveraging his architecture background to utilize JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and other modern web development frameworks.

My nameâ€™s Gavin and Iâ€™m a software engineer with a background in architectural design and sales. I find a lot of parallels between the way architects design buildings and the way engineers code apps. They both start with a conceptual design to test functionality and the initial framework. Then we develop the aesthetics to make it beautiful. Finally, we dive into the details to put it all together.

Working in sales taught me the importance of communication. In sales, you have to tap into your extroverted side to make connections with people or you wonâ€™t survive. In architecture, you also need communication skills. You learn how to articulate abstract concepts to laypeople all the time. Communication is so valuable in many industries and tech is no exception.

Web development captures many of my interests: being creative, digging into the details, finding logical solutions to problems, and using new technologies. Tech has been a lifelong passion from playing games on a Commodore 64 as a kid to designing buildings with Building Information Modelling software as an architect, and now building powerful web apps with tools like JavaScript and React.
